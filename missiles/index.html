<p>Missiles are comprised of a warhead, a guidance system, and a propulsion system. They can be launched from many platforms, including ships (including submarines), aircraft, and vehicles. Missiles are also used for a variety of purposes including surface-to-surface, meaning they are launched from the ground towards a ground target, or surface-to-air, meaning they are launched at a hostile aircraft. </p>

<p>Warheads are the contents delivered by the missile and the containers surrounding them. Warheads may include high explosive bombs, sub-structures (also known as “bomblets”), chemical weapons, and nuclear bombs. </p>

<p>Guidance systems use both active and passive methods to ensure the missile reaches its target. Passive methods include launch altitude and speed (usually from an aircraft), and active methods include onboard engines and homing devices.</p>

<p>Propulsion systems are either jet or rocket engines.</p>

<p>Missiles tested in North Korea are under the purview of the Korean People’s Army Strategic Rocket Force. It mainly tests surface-to-surface missiles from silos and launch pads (mid- to long-range), vehicles (short range), and submarines (short- to mid-range). All North Korean missiles are most likely nuclear warhead capable and can deliver warheads weighing in excess of 500kg.</p>

<p> Missile types tested in North Korea since 1984 include the following types: </p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-5 (SCUD-B): In service since 1980s</p>

<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid rocket (operational range 300km)</p>
<p class="data">Guidance: Inertial</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Limited production, short range, but relatively accurate.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-7 (AKA Nodong-1, AKA SCUD-C): In service since 1990s</p>

<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid rocket (operational range estimated 1250-1750km)</p>
<p class="data">Guidance: Inertial</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>

<p class="commentary">Commentary: Vulnerable to surveillance as they can only be fired from a vertical launch position; not very accurate (2km error). First missile developed that could reasonably strike Japan.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-8: In service since 2021</p>

<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid Rocket (operational range estimated 3200-600km)</p>
<p class="data">Guidance: Maneuverable Reentry AKA “homing”-type</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Reported as hypersonic. If true, its ability to travel faster than missile defense systems can warn and respond makes it the most threatening munition for South Korea to date.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-9 (AKA SCUD-ER): In service since 1990s
<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid Rocket (operational range estimated 700-1000km)
<p class="data">Guidance: Inertial
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle
<p class="commentary">Commentary: SCUD-ER is a SCUD-B with a smaller payload, allowing for increased range.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-10 (AKA Musudan): In service since 2010</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid Rocket (operational range estimated 3000-4000km)</p>
<p class="data">Guidance: Inertial</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Not very accurate (1.5km error); North Korea has sold a version of this missile to Iran.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong-11 (KN-02): In service since 2008</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Solid fuel rocket (operational range estimated 120-220km)</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Reverse engineered from a Soviet SCUD variant; accurate within 100m.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Hwasong -12 (KN-17): In service since 2017</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid Rocket (operational range estimated 3700-6000km)</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Considered an intermediate ballistic missile; not very accurate (2km error).</p>

<p class="missiletype">Pukguksong-1 (KN-11): In service since 2015</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Solid fuel rocket (operational range estimated 500-2500km depending on source)</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Submarine</p>
<p class="data">Commentary: Though North Korea does not possess nuclear submarines and its diesel-electric fleet is limited, a submarine-launched nuclear munition poses a potential second-strike threat against an attacker.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Pukguksong-2 (KN-15): In service since 2016</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Solid fuel rocket (operational range estimated 1200-2000m)</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Vehicle</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Has the unusual feature ability of taking and transmitting pictures of the ground when at its apogee.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Pukguksong-3 (KN-26): In service since 2019</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Solid fuel rocket (operational range estimated 1700-2500km)</p>
<p class="data">Guidance: Inertial</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Submarine</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Pukgungsong-3 has been tested once, and other untested variants have been featured mostly in parades.</p>

<p class="missiletype">Unha-2/-3 Expendable Carrier Rocket: In service since 1998</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid rocket</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Launch pad</p>
<p class="data">Rocket Dimensions: 30m tall, 2.4m diameter, 21 tonnes in weight</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Three stage rocket able to achieve low earth orbital delivery</p>

<p class="missiletype">Taepodong-1/-2: One launch on record in 2006</p>
<p class="data">Propulsion: Liquid rocket</p>
<p class="data">Launch Platform: Launch pad</p>
<p class="data">Rocket Dimensions: estimated 30m tall, 2.2m diameter, 80 tonnes in weight</p>
<p class="commentary">Commentary: Initially believed to be a two- or three-stage ballistic missile; has never been deployed as such. Provides technology base for Unha space launch vehicles.</p>

FAQ: How are rockets and missiles different?
Generally, missiles are “smart” and rockets are “dumb.” A missile has a guidance system whereas a rocket can be fired at a calculated angle – meaning it will fire a predicted ballistic trajectory – or directly upwards, the way that rockets are launched into space.
FAQ: Is an ICBM a missile?
Yes – missiles are classified into short-range (less than 1000km), medium range (1000-3000km), intermediate-range (3000-5500km), and long-range(>5500km). An ICBM is a type of long-range missile called intercontinental because they fly much farther than 5500km – an ICBM fired from Russia could hit Chicago (9156km), for example.
